      <p><strong>Hi, I'm a UTK graduate (MSc) and a self-taught ReactJS developer.</strong></p>
      <p>
        I've enjoyed programming since maybe 2010. My biggest strength is frontend development, though I definitely enjoy all parts of software.
        Also enjoy cybersecurity, old stories, linguistics, random food recipes, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2><strong>Languages & Tools:</strong><br></h2>
        Fluent in C++, C, JavaScript, Python, C#, Javaâ€”and always curious to try new ones (Rust is on the list, I swear).<br><br>
        Comfortable in Docker containers, virtual machines, and occasionally battling dependency dragons.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2><strong>Strengths:</strong><br></h2>
        Clear communication, strong documentation, and mentorship experience thanks to my time as an Undergraduate Research Assistant and as a Graduate Teaching Assistant.<br><br>
        I enjoy working with teams that share knowledge generously and ask "why" as often as "how."
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2><strong>Fun facts:</strong><br></h2>
        ðŸ’» Favorite Linux distro? Ubuntu. Arch is cool, but maybe a tad overrated.<br>
        â˜• Favorite drink? Coffee first, tea second (especially green or lavender).
