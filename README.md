      <p><strong>Hi, I'm a UTK graduate (MSc) and a self-taught ReactJS developer.</strong></p>
      <p>
        I've enjoyed programming since maybe 2010. My biggest strength is frontend development, though I definitely enjoy all parts of software.
        Also enjoy cybersecurity, old stories, linguistics, random food recipes, etc.

Fluent in C++, C, JavaScript, Python, C#, Javaâ€”and always curious to try new ones (Rust is on the list, I swear).<br><br>
Comfortable in Docker containers, virtual machines, and occasionally battling dependency dragons.
</p>

<h2>Strengths</h2>

<p>
Clear communication, strong documentation, and mentorship experience thanks to my time as an Undergraduate Research Assistant and as a Graduate Teaching Assistant.<br><br>
I enjoy working with teams that share knowledge generously and ask "why" as often as "how."
</p>

<h2>Fun facts</h2>

<p>
ðŸ’» Favorite Linux distro? Ubuntu. Arch is cool, but maybe a tad overrated.<br>
â˜• Favorite drink? Coffee first, tea second (especially green or lavender).<br>
ðŸŽµ Favorite music? Anything Daft Punk, always.<br>
ðŸŽ® Favorite games? Mostly Nintendo games â€” but I occassionally play PC games like Minecraft.<br>
ðŸ§ª Tech guilty pleasure? Adding ASCII art to code comments. Tasteful? Maybe. Necessary? Absolutely not.<br>
